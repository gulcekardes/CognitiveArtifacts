# Solver for "Physical Complexity of a Cognitive Artifact"

This repository contains the implementation of a puzzle solver developed for the paper:

> Gülce Kardeş, David Krakauer, and Joshua A. Grochow

## Solver Strategies

The implementation in [`solvers.py`](solvers.py) incorporates the following strategies:

- **Dynamic Pruning:**  
  Dynamically prunes small voids (regions of size 1 or 2) during the search to eliminate non-promising branches early.

- **Cell-Selection Strategies:**  
  The solver supports various methods to choose the next unassigned cell:
  
  - **Deterministic:**  
    Always selects the lexicographically first unassigned cell, ensuring a fixed, predictable ordering.
  
  - **Random:**  
    Chooses an unassigned cell at random, which can help avoid pathological cases inherent in fixed orderings.
  
  - **Flexibility:**  
    Uses a weighted selection that favors cells with more available candidate moves. The weighting is controlled by the parameter `--weight_power`, allowing you to adjust how much preference is given to cells with a higher number of candidates.
  
  - **MCV (Minimum Constraining Value):**  
    Selects the cell with the fewest candidate moves (i.e., the most constrained cell), aiming to reduce the search space by addressing bottlenecks early.
  
  - **Layer-Based:**  
    Prioritizes cells based on their \(z\)-coordinate, typically focusing on cells in the lowest (or highest) layer first, reflecting the physical assembly order.
  
  - **Layer_MRV:**  
    A hybrid strategy that combines layer-based ordering with the MCV heuristic, with an additional weighting parameter to balance spatial and constraint-based factors.

- **Dead State Processing:**  
  Implements a two-phase mode where the solver precomputes and records "dead states" (non-promising partial solutions) that are then pruned during subsequent search phases.

- **Biased Value Ordering:**  
  Preprocesses a set number of solutions to gather bias statistics, which are then used to guide the ordering of candidate moves during the main search.

## Execution Instructions

### Basic Execution

Run the solver with the default deterministic cell-selection strategy:

`python solvers.py`

### Using Alternative Cell-Selection Strategies

- **Random Selection:**  
  `python solvers.py --selection_choice random`

- **Flexibility Ordering:**  
  `python solvers.py --selection_choice flexibility --weight_power 2`

- **MCV:**  
  `python solvers.py --selection_choice MCV`

- **Layer-Based Ordering:**  
  `python solvers.py --selection_choice layer_based`

- **Layer_MRV Ordering:**  
  `python solvers.py --selection_choice layer_mrv --alpha 2.0`

### Enabling Advanced Features

- **Dynamic Pruning:**  
  Enable dynamic pruning of small voids:  
  `python solvers.py --pruning`

- **Dead State Processing:**  
  Precompute dead states:  
  `python solvers.py --dead_state_mode precompute`  
  Once precomputed, run the solver using the saved dead states:  
  `python solvers.py --dead_state_mode query`

- **Biased Value Ordering:**  
  Enable biased value ordering based on precomputed statistics (e.g., using 50 solutions for bias computation):  
  `python solvers.py --biased_value_ordering --preprocess_bias_solutions 50`

### Additional Options

- **Setting a Random Seed:**  
  For reproducibility, you can set a random seed:  
  `python solvers.py --seed 42`

- **Forward Checking Value Ordering:**  
  Enable forward checking for candidate value ordering:  
  `python solvers.py --forward_checking_ordering`
